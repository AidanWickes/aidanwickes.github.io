# THREE.JS INTERACTIVE KEYBOARD PROJECT

My DAT505 project is an interactive keyboard made in Three.js. To create the sounds of the keyboard, I have used the audiosynth javascript framework and used the raytracing functionality within Three.js to detect which key is being pressed and which sound should be played at the time of the onClick.

I have used the WebVR framework alongside the Google Origin Trials keys to enable my project to work in VR on my own Github repository. The VR function detects whether a VR headset has been connected and uses a button at the bottom of the screen to enter an exit the VR mode.
